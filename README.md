# AI Tools Showcase

Web application for displaying and comparing AI tools. Developed as part of the **Web Technologies Fundamentals** course at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb.

## 📋 Project Overview
This application enables users to:
- View and compare popular AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude)
- Access detailed information and usage examples for each tool
- Browse FAQs and documentation pages
- Submit reviews and suggest new tools through interactive forms

The project focuses on correct HTML semantics, CSS styling techniques, accessibility through ARIA attributes, and responsive web design principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — semantic structure of all pages
- **CSS3** — custom styling with responsive layout
- **Bootstrap 5** — applied on Documentation and About pages
- **ARIA attributes** — for form accessibility
- **JavaScript (Planned in Phase 2)** — for client-side interactivity
- **Node.js (Planned in Phase 2)** — for server-side functionality and REST API integration


## 📈 Key Features & Highlights
- 🖼️ Custom **image carousel** implemented using CSS and radio buttons
- ❓ FAQ section with table view and accordion functionality
- 📱 Fully **responsive layout** optimized for all screen sizes
- 📝 Forms with **15+ input elements** and ARIA accessibility features
- 🔗 Internal navigation and semantic structure compliant with course requirements

## 🚀 Future Development (Phase 2 - *in development*)
The project will be extended with:
- **Client-side interactivity using JavaScript** (carousel auto-scroll, image gallery lightbox, dynamic content toggling)
- **Form validation with unobtrusive JavaScript**
- **Node.js server implementation** to serve the application
- **REST API for AI tool management** (CRUD operations with CSV data handling)
- **Dynamic pages generated by Node.js** (e.g., /alati, /api/alati)

These enhancements are being developed as part of **Phase 2 (Zadaća 2)** and will further enrich the functionality and complexity of the project.
